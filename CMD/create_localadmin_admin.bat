:: This batch script is designed to create a new local administrator account and add it to the administrators group.
:: It must be run from an elevated command prompt to work correctly.

:: The first command creates a new user named 'localadmin' with a specified password.
net user localadmin password /add

:: The second command adds the newly created 'localadmin' user to the 'administrators' group, 
:: effectively granting it administrative privileges on the local machine.
net localgroup administrators localadmin /add

:: End of script.
